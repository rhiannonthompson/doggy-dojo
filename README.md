## Description
**Doggy Dojo** was my very first front-end developer project. The aim of this project was to create a landing page for a fictional business. The business concept, a ninja gym for dogs, is my original idea, as is all the copy and the logo design. I designed the logo, website layout and components using Figma and then re-implemented the design in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
